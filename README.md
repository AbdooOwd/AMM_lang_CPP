# A-- Programming Language
## What is A--
It is a programming language that I made for fun.
I originally made it in Python like 3 hours ago at the time I'm writing.
It is ***A--*** or ***AMM*** and its file extension is ***`.amm`***.

> It was originally written in **Python** in [this repo](https://github.com/AbdooOwd/AMM_lang_PY).

## About A--'s project idea
I got it when I was like 12 years old. I always thought that programming languages
scanned every character/word in the file/script to find keywords and perform their actions.

So from that I got the idea of ***A--***, I got help from no one, except some ChatGPT.

## How does it work
Originally in the Python version, you had to run `runner.py` in order to run
the `.amm` file.
So the goal of this **C++** version is to provide a standalone compiler/interpreter
to run a `.amm` file, without installing the **actual C++ compiler**.
So it works by getting the **AMM_Compiler** *(even tho it is an interpreter)*, then you put
it inside a folder. Open **CMD** in this same folder and then run the interpreter *(from **CMD**)*
and as a second argument put your `.amm` file path.

# Get Started

## Requirements
* The Interpreter.
* A `.amm` file.

### NOTES
* ***A--*** needs semicolons *( ; )* at the end of every line. Also, it doesn't need to be on
one line, just go crazy. Just don't forget to put a semicolon.

### `log`
`log` is a keyword to print text to the console, it is used like this:
```
log "Put Your Text here";
```
The text between the double quotes *( " )* is a ***String***. It is a common data type
in programming languages.
