# A-- Programming Language
## What is A--
It is a programming language that I made for fun.
I originally made it in Python like 3 hours ago at the time I'm writing.

It is ***A--*** or ***AMM*** and its file extension is ***`.amm`***

## How does it work
Originally in the Python version, you had to run `runner.py` in order to run
the `.amm` file.
So the goal of this **C++** version is to provide a standalone compiler/interpreter
to run a `.amm` file. Without installing the **actual C++ compiler**.
