# A-- Programming Language
## What is A--
It is a programming language that I made for fun.
I originally made it in Python like 3 hours ago at the time I'm writing.
It is ***A--*** or ***AMM*** and its file extension is ***`.amm`***

> It was originally written in **Python** in [this repo](https://github.com/AbdooOwd/AMM_lang_PY).

### About A--'s idea
I got it when I was like 12 years old. I always thought that programming languages
scanned every character/word to find keywords and perform their actions.

So from that I got the idea of ***A--***, I got help from no one, except some ChatGPT.

## How does it work
Originally in the Python version, you had to run `runner.py` in order to run
the `.amm` file.
So the goal of this **C++** version is to provide a standalone compiler/interpreter
to run a `.amm` file. Without installing the **actual C++ compiler**.
