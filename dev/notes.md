# Notes

## What does A-- supports until now?

### Keywords
* **`log`** - like `print()`
    * **Tip**: If you put a `-` after the `log` string, it will have no new line
* **`input`** - but cannot *use*/*store* that input
* **`var`** - to use it, use its ***M-Address***
* **`getvars`** - ***DEV TOOL*** gets all the vars with their properties
